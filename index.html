              <p>In 2007, Alameda County, California built a new Juvenile Justice Center, a $176 million complex of courtrooms, law offices, and a huge, 360-bed juvenile hall. Christian Munoz is taking me inside Juvenile Hall where he works as the Superintendent. He says he’s having trouble keeping the facility staffed.</p>

              <p>“We survive on overtime, it’s that bad,” he said.</p>

              <p>Ironically, the juvenile headcount is at an all-time low in almost five years. Still, overtime costs are soaring here -- they’re up about $6 million annually, which is more than double what it was five years ago. </p>

                <p>Bonnie Lacy was one of the guards working in Unit 1. She walked towards Rudy, making eye contact. “Fifteen minutes for me,” she told Rudy. With that,  Rudy turned around, stepped into his cell, and closed the door.</p>

                <p>The superintendent and several guards told me they prefer to talk through conflicts like this with kids. But incidents can escalate quickly. In Alameda County, with guards working an average of 30 hours of overtime per week, there has been an increase in the use of force on juvenile inmates. Guards perform takedowns or handcuff inmates when there is a confrontation. The department calls these acts “use of physical and mechanical restraints,” and that number is up nearly 300 percent.</p>

              <p>During the day, the state mandates a minimum of three guards in a 30-cell unit like this one. But, Cologne said this facility sometimes falls short. When they’re short on guards, supervisors sometimes run what they call “split recs” which divides recreation, exercise, and dinner time in half. This means that if there is one hour of rec time, 15 kids come out for recreation for 30 minutes, while the other 15 remain in their cells, before switching.</p>
