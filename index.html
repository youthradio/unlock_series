              <p>In 2007, Alameda County, California, built a new Juvenile Justice Center, a $176 million complex of courtrooms, law offices, and a huge, 360-bed incarceration facility -- juvenile hall. This May I visited the hall, where Superintendent Christian Munoz showed me around. He told me he'd been having trouble keeping the facility staffed.</p>

              <p>"We survive on overtime," he said. "It's that bad."</p>

              <p>Across the country, there are efforts to close outdated and dangerous juvenile incarceration facilities. But even in places with so-called "model" juvenile halls, counties often struggle to meet the minimum standards. Alameda County's facility, based in San Leandro, receives generally high marks, but faces some major challenges.</p>

            <p>The inmate headcount here is the lowest it's been in five years. Yet, overtime for guards is more than double what it was five years ago, according to public salary reports. Just minutes into showing me around, an announcement squawked across Munoz's walkie talkie:</p>

            <p>"If you're interested or available to work, please give me a call in the junior-seniors office."</p>

            <p>The evening shift was starting in less than an hour and Munoz was short six people. He told me this happens all the time. There are lots of reasons for the staffing shortage: guards retiring, moving over to the adult system, or filing for workers comp. Across the state, hiring into the juvenile system is a challenge. Background checks often eliminate candidates because of past criminal activity or even for having stains on their credit history.</p>

            <p>"It's difficult to run a lemonade stand like that," Munoz said. I added  it seemed like a stressful lemonade stand to run. He agreed.</p>

            <p>"Any time you're talking about supervising human lives it's an enormous amount of responsibility," he said, "and a liability for us as well."</p>

          <p>We kept moving throughout the facility, eventually pausing in the section called Unit One. It's two stories high with 15 cells on each level. From where we stood, I could hear the sound of running water from the showers nearby.</p>

          <p>On this particular day, there were three guards are on duty -- two of them working the upper and lower decks, shuffling kids back and forth from their cells to the showers. The guards were also doing room checks, looking for contraband like food, cell phones or weapons.</p>

          <p>Suddenly, a commotion broke out. A teen named Rudy had  just returned to his cell to discover the cookies and snacks he had stashed away had been confiscated. As punishment for having food in his cell, he had also been docked 15 minutes of rec time. He was upset -- yelling, and refusing to go back inside his cell.</p>

          <p>A female voice rang out across the unit: "Rudy!" It was Bonnie Lacy, one of the guards working Unit One. "Wait a minute," she told another guard, "let me go get him."</p>

          <p>She walked toward Rudy, making eye contact as she addressed him. "Fifteen minutes for me" she said, emphasizing the "me." It wasn't a command exactly -- her voice was flavored with warmth as well as firmness. The words had their desired effect on Rudy. He turned around, stepped into his cell, and closed the door.</p>

                <p>Afterward, the superintendent and several guards told me they prefer to talk through conflicts like this with kids. But incidents can escalate quickly. According to county records obtained by Youth Radio -- guards at Alameda County's Juvenile Hall used pepper spray 147 times last year.</p>

                <p>Ninety percent of state-run juvenile correctional agencies don't allow guards to carry pepper spray at all.</p>

                <p>But here, with guards working an average of 30 hours of overtime per week, there has been an increase in the use of force on juvenile inmates -- like guards performing take-downs or handcuffing detainees. The department calls these acts "use of physical and mechanical restraints," and that number has nearly tripled in the last five years.</p>
